Pocket Guide: Birds of East Africa by Dave Richards Book Review

Name: shep
Rating: 5.0 out of 5 stars
Title: Excellent as a small pocket guide
Date: Reviewed in the United States on November 18, 2018
Review: This is a small book, light and easily pocketable. Despite its small size, it has a remarkable 296 birds listed, each with one or two photographs. Additionally, it mentions dozens of other birds in the text without a photo, such as "the very similar pale flycatcher is pale brown‚Ä¶". This was sometimes very useful when a bird looked somewhat like the one pictured but was not quite right. I encountered a couple of birds not here, but it's pretty comprehensive.
The pages are a bit too thick to flip through easily, but not too bad. DON'T get books like this on Kindle--it's not a good medium for reference books.
It covers Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi, and Uganda.
If you want more birds and more detail, consider other, larger, books. I also like "Birds of the Serengeti, and Ngorogoro" by A.S.Kennedy. But it's larger and heavier. But the smaller book Birds of East Africa was my first go-to book for a new bird.
Excellent.

Title: to the Masai Mara and Serengeti and the guides loved it and I did too
Date: Reviewed in the United States on December 22, 2016
Review: I took this book with me to the Masai Mara and Serengeti and the guides loved it and I did too! I am actually buying another copy to send back to the Masai warrior that was our guide. It is great when you have the paper copy. The book is compact and light which is important when you are traveling with a restricted weight limit.

Title: Informative but needs links
Date: Reviewed in the United States on October 10, 2016
Review: The biggest drawback to the kindle version of this book is there are no links from the index to the birds I was trying to locate and it took a long time to find them in the book. Many other books like this have links from the index to the page where the bird information is located.

Title: Not to be used to identify birds
Date: Reviewed in the United States on July 1, 2019
Review: Tried to use this book in Tanzania and Namibia with little success or satisfaction. It has good pictures and descriptions but, there is no system to the bird listing unless you already know the name. Birds are not grouped by common characteristics making identification difficult unless you page through the book until you find the appropriate picture.
